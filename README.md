## 🔥 Why I Do This

Technology is moving fast — but so are threats.

My mission is to protect meaningful digital products before someone else breaks them.  
I work with creators and builders, helping them challenge assumptions and secure the parts of their systems that are often overlooked.  
To me, **offensive security is not about chaos — it's about clarity**.

I don’t just look for what’s broken. I question what was assumed to be safe.

## 💣 What I Do

I specialize in **Web & API Pentesting**, with hands-on experience in:
- Application-layer vulnerabilities: XSS, SQLi, RCE, authentication bypass  
- API testing: BOLA, IDOR, Broken Auth, insecure tokens  
- Cloud misconfigurations: exposed S3 buckets, metadata abuse, IAM flaws  
- Logic flaws and chained vulnerabilities  
- Manual recon, chaining attack vectors, and tailored exploitation  
- Clean, actionable reports that developers actually use

## 🧰 Tools I Work With

- Nmap – for precise scanning, service detection, custom NSE scripts  
- ffuf – for fast and recursive directory and parameter fuzzing  
- Burp Suite – manual request analysis, interception, and chaining  
- SQL techniques – error-based, boolean-based, time-based injections and bypasses  
- Netcat, curl, dig, whois – essential tools for live network and service inspection  
- Wireshark – for low-level packet analysis when recon requires depth
